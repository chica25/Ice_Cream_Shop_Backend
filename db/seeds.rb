    :description => "Bellatrix is a massive star with about 8.6 times the Sun's mass. It has an estimated age of approximately 25 million yearsâ€”old enough for a star of this mass to consume the hydrogen at its core and begin to evolve away from the main sequence into a giant star.[17] The effective temperature of the outer envelope of this star is 22000 K,[9] which is considerably hotter than the 5,778 K on the Sun. This high temperature gives this star the blue-white hue that occurs with B-type stars",
